# CV Interview

## Who are you?

I'm Franco, a *venezuelan-spanish-argentinian* mix of cultures and yes, I can impersonate each one of those accents.

I also speak **english**, **italian** and **catalan** and I'm up for a conversation to keep practicing them if you're up too.

## What drives you on a day to day basis? 

Easy: **knowledge**. Personally, I love teaching and hence the need to constantly add, update and upgrade my knowledge in every field that I think of and that way feel happy in some sense when I see the enlightment in people's eyes whenever they understood what I taught them.

I'm a very logical person so, up until now, I've focused on subjects like science, physics, maths, finances, accounting.

## What about your soft skills?

I've always liked to work in teams, achieve huge things, brainstorming ideas and bringing them to life. As I said before, I'm a logical person, and most of us have to develope those skills from scratch and so I did. **Leadership** is the skill I like most. Giving credit where the credit is due and motivate others to earn that credit too, that's what I imagine when someone asks me how to describe a good leader.

## As a develper, what has been the most difficult thing you've experienced so far?

I have 2 years of working experience as a software developer, I would say it's not even a long time but we all experience the same thing daily: frustration. I had to learn to control it and learn from it. I still do, in fact.

## What is you "Stack"? Why do they call it that way?

It's just for simplicity. It's as simple as imagining a stack of skills and tools that you've learned or worked with. 

In my case I've worked with many technologies and intend to add some more.

Let's start with programming languages in chronological order: MatLab, C, Javascript, Typescript, PHP

I'm mostly oriented to backend so I've worked with Express, NestJs, NextJs (yes, backend too) and Laravel as backend frameworks. I've worked with relational databases (SQL) and its ORM's like MySQL, PostgreSQL, OracleDB with Sequelize, TypeORM, Prisma, Eloquent and non-relational databases (NO-SQL) like MongoDB with ODM's Mongoose

Some useful knowledge in infrastructure tools like Docker, AWS (EC2 and S3), Vercel

## And what about the non-developer Franco?

He's an enthusiast of many things but the greatest joy comes from music: singing, dancing and instruments like drums, guitars!

## Well then, it's been a pleasure to meet you, Franco.

It's been a pleasure to tell my story. Thanks a lot and hope to see you around here any time soon!
